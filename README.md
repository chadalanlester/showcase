## üëã About Me

I‚Äôm **Chad Lester**, a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**.
This repository is part of my professional portfolio ‚Äî a **public showcase** of my skills and approach to automation, infrastructure-as-code, and DevSecOps practices.

I maintain a full homelab environment where I build and test modern infrastructure patterns using:
- üñ•Ô∏è **Proxmox** for virtualization
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- üõ†Ô∏è **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI/CD** for pipelines
- üì¶ **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **Ansible** for automation and provisioning
- üìä **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Alertmanager** for monitoring and alerting

I also work with **public cloud providers** ‚Äî **Azure**, **AWS**, and **Google Cloud** ‚Äî and showcase workflows and IaC examples for these platforms.

This repository is meant for **employers** to review my skills in action: demonstrating clarity, automation, and security-first design.

# Showcase Workflows

This repository contains **sanitized, public-safe examples** of the CI/CD and DevSecOps pipelines I run in my homelab.
It demonstrates how I structure pipelines, enforce security scanning, and integrate Infrastructure-as-Code checks ‚Äî without exposing real secrets or infrastructure.

---

## üöÄ Workflows

### Continuous Integration (CI)
[![Showcase CI](https://github.com/chadalanlester/showcase/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/chadalanlester/showcase/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The **CI pipeline** runs automatically on pushes, pull requests, or manual dispatch.
It demonstrates a full multi-stage process:

- **Linting**
  - YAML lint (`yamllint`)
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**
  - Terraform `init` + `plan`
- **Security scanning**
  - Trivy filesystem scan
  - tfsec Terraform security analysis
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**
  - Syft generates SPDX JSON artifact

### Security Scans
[![Security Scans](https://github.com/chadalanlester/showcase/actions/workflows/security.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/chadalanlester/showcase/actions/workflows/security.yml)

The **Security workflow** provides a focused DevSecOps example:
- **Trivy** for vulnerability/misconfiguration scanning
- **tfsec** for Terraform static analysis
- **Syft** for SBOM generation and artifact upload

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

- All scans run in **Docker containers**, no host dependencies.
- **No secrets required** ‚Äî workflows run safely in public without exposing credentials.
- **SBOM artifacts** are generated and uploaded for transparency.

---

## üí° Key Practices Demonstrated

- ‚úÖ Multi-stage CI/CD with dependencies
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure-as-Code validation (Terraform)
- ‚úÖ Security scanning with Trivy, tfsec
- ‚úÖ SBOM generation (Syft)
- ‚úÖ Style compliance with yamllint
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions badges for instant visibility

---

## üß∞ Technologies √ó Workflows

| Technology / Tool          | Showcase CI | Security Scans |
|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **YAML Lint (yamllint)**   | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **Terraform (init/plan)**  | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (scanned with tfsec) |
| **Ansible**                | Demo playbook included | ‚ùå |
| **Trivy**                  | ‚úÖ (filesystem scan) | ‚úÖ (filesystem scan) |
| **tfsec**                  | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Syft (SBOM)**            | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Docker**                 | ‚úÖ (all jobs run via Docker images) | ‚úÖ |
| **GitHub Actions**         | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

‚úÖ = tool is actively used in that workflow
‚ùå = not applicable

---

## üìù Notes

- **Terraform** ‚Üí Uses only `null_resource` ‚Üí safe and non-destructive.
- **Ansible** ‚Üí Playbook contains a simple `debug` message ‚Üí illustrates CI integration, but does not target real hosts.
- **Badges** ‚Üí Reflect the current status of CI and security scans on the `main` branch.
